# QuickSortWorseCase
The implementation of the algorithm Quick Sort where we detect the execution time for the worst case

### Quick Sort

Quick sort is one of the most popular sorting algorithm.
Many programming languages even C (function qsort()) include a built-in implementation.
However, in spite of its short average time complexity O(n log n), 
the algorithm takes O(n^2) time for the worst input case, which is too slow for practice use.
